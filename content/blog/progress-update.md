It's been a few months since we [announced FLOSS/fund](/blog/announcing-floss-fund), our $1M annual funding initiative for Free and Open Source Software projects. Today, we'd like to share a brief update on our progress.

### Review process

Our team has begun reviewing applications, and we're encouraged by the quality and diversity of submissions. We've received applications from various interesting projects, including developer tools, infrastructure libraries, and community-driven initiatives, each with well-documented funding.json manifests outlining their requirements. Check out the projects on the [open directory](https://dir.floss.fund).

### Disbursal process
In addition to direct disbursals, we are in discussions with GitHub and Open Collective. Many FLOSS projects already use these platforms for receiving contributions, and integrating with their existing payment infrastructure could significantly reduce the operational overhead for both maintainers and our team.

### Timeline

We aim to complete the review of our first batch of applications and begin disbursing funds by April 2025. This timeline allows us to thoroughly evaluate each submission while setting up the necessary infrastructure for sustainable, long-term support.

For those interested in applying, submissions remain open at [dir.floss.fund/submit](https://dir.floss.fund/submit).

We will share more detailed insights about the funding process and selected projects in our next update.
