At [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/), our commitment to Free (libre) and Open Source Software (FOSS) remains strong. Last year, we [joined the Open Source Pledge](@/blog/open-source-pledge-2024.md) and committed to sharing annual reports of our financial contributions. This is our 2025 report.

The [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com) encourages companies to contribute at least \$2,000 per full-time developer annually to the open source projects they depend on. We continue to exceed this baseline significantly.

### Past 12 months

This year, we have contributed a total of over {{ pledge_stat(year="2025", stat="total") }}, averaging approximately {{ pledge_stat(year="2025", stat="per_dev") }} per developer. This represents a more than {{ pledge_stat(year="2025", stat="increase") }} increase from our 2024 contribution of {{ pledge_stat(year="2025", stat="prev_total") }}.

A significant portion of this year's contributions flows through [FLOSS/fund](https://floss.fund), our initiative launched in October 2024 to support critical Free and Open Source projects globally. Through FLOSS/fund, we have allocated \$1 million in 2025 across two tranches to projects ranging from OpenSSL and FFmpeg to Blender and OpenStreetMap. The {{ pledge_item(year="2025", name="FLOSS/fund") }} figure below represents completed disbursements, with the remainder in process.

We have also contributed {{ pledge_item(year="2025", name="GitHub SOSS fund") }} to the [GitHub Secure Open Source Fund](https://github.com/open-source/github-secure-open-source-fund) to help maintain and secure the open source ecosystem.

Additionally, we have contributed approximately {{ pledge_item(year="2025", name="FOSS United") }} to the [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org/) to support the open source ecosystem in India. Through FOSS United, we have also co-sponsored grants for promising projects.

#### Contributions over the past years

At Zerodha, our commitment to the open source community extends beyond financial contributions. We have actively engaged in initiatives that foster the sustainability of FOSS. We co-founded the [FOSS United Foundation](https://fossunited.org/) to bolster the open source ecosystem in India. We also support [TinkerHub](https://tinkerhub.org/), a hub for FOSS tinkering and innovation. Additionally, we continue to maintain [several open source projects](https://zerodha.tech/projects/) that originated from our work at Zerodha.

Over the years, we have also provided direct support to various projects through service agreements, support plans, and direct grants, agreed upon collaboratively with project maintainers.

By sharing our contributions, we hope to inspire other companies to take similar steps. Supporting the open source projects we rely on is not just a responsibility; it's an opportunity to contribute to a sustainable and innovative future for the tech industry.

We are excited to continue our support for the open source community. Together, we can build a more sustainable and innovative future for open source software.
