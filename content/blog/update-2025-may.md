We are happy to announce our first tranche—9 open source projects and organisations receiving a total of **$325,000** for the continued and sustainable development and maintenance of critical software.

Since launching FLOSS/fund in October 2024, we've received applications from diverse projects. Our experimental approach of soliciting applications through the open, publicly indexable [`funding.json`](https://fundingjson.org) manifest, has not only helped our overall processes significantly, but has encouraged many projects to start structuring and publicising their FOSS funding needs.

The necessary logistical and legal paperwork for disbursal are at different stages across projects. In the coming months, we hope to streamline our processes to bring down the disbursal time significantly. We will update this post as the status changes, in addition to publishing a consolidated annual report.

We are in talks with GitHub to build a close integration for quick fund disbursals via GitHub Sponsors as a majority of applications prefer GitHub as the avenue for receiving payments.

## Apply now

Are you a FOSS project? You can [apply for funding](https://dir.floss.fund/submit) any time. If you are unfamiliar with FLOSS/fund, please see the [announcement](https://floss.fund/blog/announcing-floss-fund/) post.

We hope our structured approach encourages other organisations to establish similar funding programs for the FOSS ecosystem.
